Version 1.0.0
- NEW: Everything is new.

Version 1.0.1
- BUG FIX: During initialization of the accumulator, the last item of the
           lookup table defining the discrete theta values was not initialized.
           In such case, the value should be 180-delta degrees. As a result,
           detected lines having theta = 180-delta were getting a random angular
           value. The authors would like to thank Dave Wood for point out this
           problem.
